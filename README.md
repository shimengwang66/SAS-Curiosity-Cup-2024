## Deciphering the Influence of Ad Rank on Customer Engagement in Search Engine Marketing using SASÂ®
This study examines the impact of ad rank on keyword auction performance within search engine marketing, utilizing a dataset provided by Yahoo. The dataset, which spans a four- month period, includes data points such as anonymized advertiser account ID, anonymized key-phrase, rank, impressions, and clicks. This information forms the foundation for analyzing the relationship between ad rank and customer engagement. In this study, we crafted and analyzed several metrics of customer engagement, including the volume of clicks generated, the number of impressions obtained, and the click-through rate (defined as the ratio of clicks to impressions). Our primary goal is to explore the relationship between enhancements in ad rank and their subsequent impact on customer engagement levels. The results of this analysis could provide valuable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their search engine advertising strategies. It is particularly relevant for those considering the benefits of increasing their ad spend to secure higher ad positions, thereby enhancing ad visibility and potentially driving better campaign performance.
